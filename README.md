# Zomato-Analysis-Interactive-Dashboard-Power-BI 
### Project Description
This project involves the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Zomato sales data. The dashboard provides key insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.
### Key Features:
Data Source: The data is sourced from Zomato's public dataset.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor in Power BI to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

Data Modeling: A star schema data model was implemented to optimize the relationships between different tables.

KPIs: Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average order value, the number of orders, and customer retention rate are calculated and displayed.

Visualizations: The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations, including:
Sales by city and restaurant and price range by cuisines (Clustered column chart and clustered bar chart),
Count of restaurants by Country name (pie chart),
Order analysis (tables and matrices).

DAX Measures: Complex calculations and business logic are implemented using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create insightful metrics.
### Question KPI's:
what are the total count of restuarants?

which are the top 5 cities by no.of restuarants?

Count of cities and countries

Count of Cuisines

what is the average cost of two?
### Technologies Used:
